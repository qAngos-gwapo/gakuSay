		<h1>My Learnings</h1>
		<img src="../images/book.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
		<p>This school year has been different for all of us, as we are introduced to a
		completely new method of learning, which is through online means. As it is everyone’s 
		first time, we learned many things in the span of one school year.<br><br> One major thing I 
		myself have learned is that the Philippines in general is not ready for this online method 
		of learning. We are suffering very slow internet speeds, and as a third world country, many 
		cannot afford neccesarry gadgets in order to partake in the online learning. <br><br>Second, it is not 
		as inspiring as the normal face to face classes. Many people go to school to meet up with friends, 
		and sees friends as a reason to learn. Some also see school as a reason to go out of the house and 
		socialize; with online classes, this is not possible, thus lessening people’s reason to study.<br><br> Finally, 
		many schools do not take into consideration the student’s mental state during the online class. There 
		aren’t many breaks during the scope of this first school year in the online class, thus there were many 
		assignments given to the students. Some students with weaker will will suffer more as the workload that 
		is given can’t be handled. These are some learnings that I realized after the first year of online class.</p>
